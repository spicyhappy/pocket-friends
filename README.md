pocket-friends
==============

Pocket Friends is a mobile game that's sort of like Pokemon with geolocation. Right now it only works in the Boston Commons and is very hacky. Maybe when I have some more time and get a real developer to help out, it'll be as awesome as I imagined it to be.

The dev version is here: https://github.com/xinsq/pocket-friends
